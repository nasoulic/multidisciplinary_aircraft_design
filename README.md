Multidisciplinary Novel Aircraft Design Application
Welcome to the Multidisciplinary Novel Aircraft Design application.
This application provides a user-friendly interface to assist in various stages of aircraft design, configuration, and evaluation.
        
Features:
- Configure different components of the aircraft.
- Perform sizing calculations for the aircraft.
- Evaluate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Direct Operating Costs (DOC).
- View the aircraft design and export designs in different formats.
- Configure the Thermal Management System (TMS).
        
Explore the different menus and buttons to make the most of this application.

Installation Guidelines:

1) Download OpenVSP-3.38.0-win64 from the following website: https://openvsp.org/download.php

    NOTE: If you don't want to use the latest version of OpenVSP you can skip this step. A working version of OpenVSP is 
    located in the ./aircraft_visualisation/OpenVSP-3.38.0-win64 path.

2) Follow the instructions found on the OpenVSP-3.38.0-win64/python/README.md file to create the conda environment supporting the OpenVSP python API (Summarised below).
    2.1) Open a command prompt window and navigate to relative path: ./OpenVSP-3.38.0-win64/python/
    2.2) run <conda env create -f .\environment.yml>
    2.3) run <conda activate mdhead_vsp>
    2.4) run <pip install -r requirements-dev.txt>

3) Install openmdao and PyQt5 in the new vsp conda environment:
    3.1) Activate the conda environment
    3.2) run <pip install openmdao>
    3.3) run <pip install PyQt5>
    3.4) run <pip install pyDOE2>

4) Copy the OpenVSP-3.38.0-win64/CustomScripts folder to your Users file directory (e.g. C:\Users\<myusername>\CustomScripts)

5) Done.

NOTE: This project has been built using Python 3.11. Variations in the Python version may require additional actions to install the project.
