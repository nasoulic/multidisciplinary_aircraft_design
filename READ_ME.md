Installation Guidelines:

1) Download OpenVSP-3.38.0-win64 from the following website: https://openvsp.org/download.php

	NOTE: If you don't want to use the latest version of OpenVSP you can skip this step. A working version of OpenVSP is 
	located in the ./aircraft_visualisation/OpenVSP-3.38.0-win64 path.

2) Follow the instructions found on the OpenVSP-3.38.0-win64/python/README.md file to create the conda environment supporting the OpenVSP python API (Summarised below).
	2.1) Open a command prompt window and navigate to relative path: ./OpenVSP-3.38.0-win64/python/
	2.2) run <conda env create -f .\environment.yml>
	2.3) run <conda activate mdhead_vsp>
	2.4) run <pip install -r requirements-dev.txt>

3) Install openmdao and PyQt5 in the new vsp conda environment:
	3.1) Acivate the conda environment
	3.2) run <pip install openmdao>
	3.3) run <pip install PyQt5>
	3.4) run <pip install pyDOE2>

4) Copy the OpenVSP-3.38.0-win64/CustomScripts fodler to your Users file directory (e.g. C:\Users\<myusername>\CustomScripts)
